Q:What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as the most useful?
<br>
A: I think the purpose of the HTML 5 semantic tags is to describe the meaning of exactly what is inside the tags and keep it uniform so the developer and the computer don't have to work harder to find out what is inside the tag. I think the most usesful ones are the header, footer, nav and main. Header and footer because thats where you can link to other pages or put contact information and the nav because thats how you link to other sites and pages. Finally the main because thats where the most of the sites content goes for a paragraph or main purpose of the site.
<br>
<br>
Q:What is the order the browser uses to display elements on the page?
<br>
A: The browser displays elements on the page from top to bottom. Depending on the order of the tags in the body, it goes from top to bottom displaying the contents of each tab.

Q:What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you create more handy snippets at a later date?
<br>
A: I learned how sublime uses snippits in the first place and how to create them. I also learned that the scope in snippits dictates where the snippit can be use and how it shows up afterwards. I do think I will use them at a later date if I ever find I use something that the norrmal html snippit doesn't have a lot of the time.
<br>
<br>
Q: What concept in this challenge was the most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
<br>
A:The concept in this challenge that was the most difficult for me was when each semantic was used. While I was able to look it up online and had my pair, it was still hard to understand when each was used untill I did the task and saw it actually working. I can improve my understanding of the concept by using them because I need to seer them work and understand when they are used.
