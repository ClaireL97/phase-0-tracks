Elevator Algorithm
When elevator use is needed.
-Roll up the the elevator
-Check Current floor number and store that value as current floor number
-Ask master what floor number to go to.
	- If valid floor, proceed to next step
	- If invalid floor, ask again.
	- If told current floor say "I am already on that floor"
	- If told command "cancel that" stop asking and wait for new orders.
-Save the ordered floor number as destination floor number
-Using the destination floor number and the current floor number:
	-If current floor number is less than destination floor number,press 	the up arrow
	-If the current floor number is greater than the destination floor 	number, press the down arrow.

- Roll into the elevator when the doors open and stop in front of the controrl buttons inside.

-Locate the button that has the same value as stored destination floor number.

-Press the button and sit tight for the ride
-When the doors open roll out of the elevator
-Delete current floor value
	(could also make it keep a value stored for a long period of time 	instead of deleting it but decided to do it this way so that if my 	robot takes the stairs and is on a different current floor, it 	doesn't get mixed up.)
-Delete stored destination floor number.
-Report to master that elevator travel is complete
