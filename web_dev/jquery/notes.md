### Plan
* Search JQuery and learn what it is
* Look up how to install it for a project
* Find resources that tell basics of JQuery (like what it can do)
* Find Syntax list and save for references
* Find a couple examples for things that seem important with JQuery
* Test material that stands out as preforming basic actions
* Take a break at 1 hour researching for a few minutes to stretch and refocus



### Result

My plan ended up working well. I found a couple sites that worked and had a lot of information and examples and they helped a lot. I ended up testing it out on a couple files and found the examples helped a lot on a few others. I saved a page with a lot of the syntax for JQuery too for reference even when I still need to look them up to remember what some do that I didn't look closely into. I took a break but it wasn't after an hour. It was more like once I kept seeing the same thing over and over and not getting further that I took my break.
