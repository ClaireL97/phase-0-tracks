In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

* A VPS is an online machine that acts as a computer. You use your own computer in order to connect to it and use it. It has it's own operating system. A user has max level access and so they can install almost anything that can run on the OS. VPS are useful because there is more control than shared hosting and have more stability 

**Optional bonus question:** Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

* It is considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system because the system gives you so much power. Because it gives you so much, it means that any human error will cause a lot more damage and affect more without the system stopping you.
