* completed by Claire Lindblom

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* **What is version control?  Why is it useful?**
* Version control is a way of creating and saving a change log of additions and modifications. It is useful because it is a reference for people to see past changes and create save points that can be referenced at later times. It can also be used
* **What is a branch and why would you use one?**
* A branch is a copy of the main file where edits can be made without affecting the main file. The branch can later be merged with the main file to create a final product. All commits made to the branch will not affect the main until it is merged. It is used in order to make changes and test them out before committing them to the main branch.

* **What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?**
* A commit is the creation of a save point or record in the change log in version control. A good commit message is one that is to the point and tells people exactly what was added, removed or altered in an easy to understand way.

* **What is a merge conflict?**
* A merge conflict is when something goes wrong while merging or pulling from a branch. One part of code or something in the file won't like something else and it will print out there is conflict and then to fix it.
